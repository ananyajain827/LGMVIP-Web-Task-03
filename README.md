# registration form
🚀check it out🚀
# 📋 Project Overview:
I created a dynamic registration form where users can sign up, and their details are displayed on the same page. The form includes fields for:
Name
Email
Password and Confirm Password
Profile Image upload

# 🔧 What I Built:
Form Validation: Ensured that the passwords match and that all fields are filled out.
Image Handling: Added an image preview feature to display the profile picture before submission.
Dynamic Data Display: Registered users’ information is displayed in a table on the same page.

# 💡 Skills Demonstrated:
HTML & CSS for creating the form layout and styling.
JavaScript for form validation, image handling, and dynamic table updates.

I’m always looking to learn and grow, so feel free to reach out if you have any feedback or if you’re interested in discussing similar projects. 🤝
